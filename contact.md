## Licensing

Except where otherwise stated,
all content on this website is available under both of the following licences:

* [Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
* [MIT/Expat (MIT)](/LICENSE)

You may choose under which of these licences you wish to use any content.

Both licences are permissive,
requiring only that you correctly attribute me in any work including or derived
from any part of this website;
the MIT licence requires that you do this by including the (short) licence text
and copyright notice linked above in any derivative works,
while the CC-BY licence is more flexible.
Under both licences, you are free to relicense your derivative work under any
terms you wish,
provided that the section derived from my work is clearly identified.

I recommend that you use text and images from this website under CC-BY terms,
and that you use any portions of this website's source code,
or any code snippets included in blog posts,
under MIT terms,
but you are free to choose either licence for any purpose.

If you wish to obtain a licence to use any of my intellectual property under a
different set of terms
(without attribution,
including explicit clauses regarding patent rights[^1],
etc.),
please get in touch using one of the contact methods listed above.
If your request is reasonable,
I will try to accommodate it.

***

[^1]: Note, however, that no patents are currently claimed on any of my
      intellectual property, and that it is my intent that the
      "without limitation" line in the MIT licence text be considered
      an explicit licence of any relevant patents.
