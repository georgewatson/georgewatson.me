Following on from my [catastrophic failure to correctly use
`rsync`]({% post_url 2019-04-05-whoops %}),
accompanied by some frustration with WordPress+MySQL's memory hogging,
I have decided to make like a bird and migrate&nbsp;---
to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It's much nicer this way.
Some features may be missing for a while&nbsp;---
tag pages ~~and sharing links~~ are the most obvious casualties&nbsp;---
but nobody used those anyway.
