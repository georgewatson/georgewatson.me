Following on from my [catastrophic failure to correctly use
`rsync`]({% post_url meta/2019-04-05-whoops %}),
accompanied by some frustration with WordPress+MySQL's memory hogging,
I have decided to make like a bird and migrate ---
to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It's much nicer this way.
Some features may be missing for a while ---
tag pages and sharing links are the most obvious casualties ---
but nobody used those anyway.
