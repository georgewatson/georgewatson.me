I love science.
I love the academic environment
and I love the work I do.
I even think I'm quite good at it.
But I'm leaving --
I'm taking my PhD
and heading to pastures new
in the big, scary outside world,
and I'd like to share my reasons.

<!--more-->

***

I have wanted to be a scientist
for as long as I can remember,
apart from a brief
*Ally McBeal*-fuelled
teenage
flirtation with
the law,
and over the last few years
I have had the immense privilege
of making that a reality.
My PhD has been a genuine blast---I get to
do really cool, exciting new work
and boldly see things no man has seen before.
I have been tremendously fortunate
to work with
a universally wonderful,
impressive,
and supportive group of people.[^york]
If I could stay forever,
I probably would.
But I can't,
and there's the rub.

[^york]: I would wholeheartedly recommend
       the
       [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/),
       and especially the
       [Noy](https://agnesnoylab.wordpress.com/)
       and
       [Leake](http://www.single-molecule-biophysics.org/)
       groups,
       to anybody
       looking for a position in the
       [physics of life](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics/research/physics-of-life/),
       and am happy to talk to anybody interested in joining them.
       Please don't let this essay
       put you off
       following your dreams.

You see---and this is where I expect to lose
any sympathy you may harbour for me---I
am a tremendously privileged person.
I have had the excellent fortune
to have found the person I believe to be the love of my life,
who---very selfishly---has a career of her own.
Through several strokes of luck
and the generosity of others,
we own a home,
of which we are quite fond.
One day,
I should like to have a dog,
and maybe even become a parent.
Most academics do all of these things,
but they are stronger people than I am.

### The academic trajectory

I say this because
of the very nature of
life as an early-career academic,
or postdoc,
which would represent my next step
were I to follow an academic path.
I applied for exactly one postdoc position,
in a particularly impressive group
doing some really exciting work
in a city of which I am very fond,
and was fortunate enough to get an interview.
And I found myself,
quite unexpectedly,
hoping that I would not be offered the job.
I surprised myself;
many people report their postdoc years
as among the happiest of their career---spending
all day, every day
immersed in the research about which they are most passionate,
unburdened by the other legs of the academic tripos,
the much-maligned
teaching and administration.[^tripos]
I expect this is true.

[^tripos]: Some
    more jaded than myself
    might prefer to call these
    heads of the academic hydra.

The only downside is that,
in the words of
George Harrison MBE,
[All Things Must Pass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWV4pFV5nX4).[^harrison]
All good things come to an end,
and employment contracts are no exception.
The typical postdoctoral position
in the UK
lasts for around two to three years.
After that,
it's time to pack your bags
and move on to the next one,
probably at a different university
on the other side of the country---and
probably do this more than once.
(In my experience
it is far from uncommon to
hold multiple postdoctoral positions
before finding a permanent job;
the statistics on this are surprisingly sparse
but I'll present the best I could find in a few paragraphs' time.)

[^harrison]: It may be unfair to credit this quote to Harrison,
    as he adapted it from a poem entitled
    "[All Things Pass](https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/all-things-pass)"
    by Dr Timothy Leary,
    who in turn translated it from
    an original by
    Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu,
    author of the
    [*Tao Te Ching*](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Tao_Te_Ching),
    but it's a good song
    so I'm doing it.

<aside>
  <blockquote class="pull-quote">
    I realised then
    that this path&nbsp;—
    the one I'd always thought I wanted to walk&nbsp;—
    was not for me.
  </blockquote>
</aside>

And that's why I didn't want the job---because
I knew I'd take it,
but the idea of everything that would entail,
of commuting long distances,
of regularly spending nights away from home,
of potentially relocating
and leaving behind everything we have built here
without any guarantee that
I'd even be able to stay
for more than a few years,
made me
sad
and afraid.
Thankfully,
I was not put in that position
and the job was undoubtedly offered to
someone far more qualified than myself.
But I realised then
that this path---the one I'd always thought I wanted to walk---was
not for me.

This may be unreasonable of me.
Packing up your life,
dragging loved ones behind you
along with all your worldly possessions,
may be troublesome,
but
people move for their careers all the time.
At least there's a permanent job at the end of it,
right?
Apparently not---it turns out that
[only 10% of postdocs will ever find a permanent academic
position](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/179895/to-academic-question-postdocs/).

But at least it's great experience
for a career in industry,
right?
The consensus seems to be that no,
it is not.
In the words of
[a Stack Exchange
answer](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/60274/is-postdoc-experience-valued-by-industry):

But at least you're having fun...
right?
Studies seem to indicate that,
once again,
[the answer is no](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5873519/):

One lecturer,
Dr Alexandre Afonso
(then
of King's College London,
now of Leiden University),
went so far as to
[compare the academic job market to drug gangs](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/12/11/how-academia-resembles-a-drug-gang/)
as they were described in
Prof. Levitt and Mr Dubner's
seminal

I wanted to find statistics
regarding the median age of UK academics
upon receiving their first permanent contract.
This was the best I could do:
According to
table 21 of
[a report by the Higher Education Statistics Agency](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/publications/staff-2016-17),
the median age of
the inflow into
the population employed on teaching and research contracts
(94% of which are permanent,
compared to just 33% of research-only contracts,
according to chart 12 of
[the same report's introduction](https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/publications/staff-2016-17/introduction))
falls between 36 and 40,
although admittedly much of this
may be inflow of
experienced academics
from outside the UK.
Conservatively,
this suggests that
even the exceptional 10% who *do* find a permanent contract
do not typically do so
until their mid-thirties,
following around a decade of
precarious
post-PhD
employment,
but I would be interested in seeing some better statistics on this.

Of course,
much of this is probably field-dependent---it
is quite possible that
I would have it easier,
in the sciences,
than do my colleagues in the humanities,
or *vice versa*.
But it is clear that there is a problem.
Within academia,
we hear,
of course,
only from those who did make it---Dr Afonso's drug lords.
To them,
the whole experience was worthwhile.
We don't hear from the other 90%,
who tried and failed---and
it *is* considered a failure
to leave academia,
despite being by far the modal outcome.
To them,
the whole thing probably doesn't feel so worthwhile.
I'm not dragging my life---and my fiancée's---across the country
to gamble on an outcome
that exists only in the tails
of the probability distribution.
I have pledged to take the road more travelled by.

### The problem

Losing me
is no great loss to the academy,
but I am not alone.
If we keep shutting people out of science
by making the profession inconvenient
and unpleasant,
rather than merely difficult,
it is only a matter of time before
at least one great,
potentially world-changing genius
takes a job in the private sector instead.
I reckon they already have.[^genius]
Besides,
every mind we lose
takes with it
a unique set of skills
and a unique perspective,
leaving us poorer,
and
we all miss out
by making ourselves,
our colleagues
and our friends
miserable for the first decade of our careers.
Is it worth it?

[^genius]: Of course,
    the narrative of the lone genius
    revolutionising their field
    is a well worn
    and overly simplistic one---science
    is a story
    of gradual,
    incremental
    refinement of knowledge
    by a global collective of minds---but
    I think the point holds.

While
I would not dare to suggest that
I know the panacæa for modern academic woes,
I wish for this piece to come across
not as a hollow rant
but as a contribution to a constructive discussion
about the lifestyles
and mental health
of academics everywhere.
To that end,
I wish to put forth
my uninformed hypotheses
about where the problem
(such as it is)
may lie.

As with most situations
involving human interactions,
the natural place to begin
would seem to be in the language of œconomics
(in which I am far from an expert).
For example,
the number of PhD graduates
far exceeds the supply of postdoc positions,
which in turn far exceeds
the supply of permanent academic jobs.
This is a classic imbalance of supply and demand,
which is not a problem *per se*,
and should be more obvious
than it perhaps seems,
but does not align with everyone's expectations.[^expectations]
This imbalance
creates an effective oligopsony---a buyers' market
in which the universities have the power
to impose conditions according to their own incentives.

[^expectations]: How many times have the average PhD student's grandparents
    been shocked to discover that
    one does not simply walk into <!-- mordor -->
    a permanent academic job?
    Perhaps
    [too](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Geller)
    [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Mosby)
    [sitcoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)
    have given them the wrong impression.

What are their incentives?
Employees are expensive
and might not work out.
No employer wants to be stuck with
a permanent employee
who turns out to be a bit rubbish.
Short-term,
grant-funded
employment
is a much safer bet:
The work gets done
without staking a penny on it,
and these employees are
interchangeable
and easily replaced
when the money runs out.
This also suits the funding bodies,
who similarly want to minimise
their own exposure to
risk of waste;
and academics who already have permanent jobs,
who are free to select the best candidate
on a per-project basis,
which is beneficial
since their own careers
depend on
a steady stream of
grants and publications.

<aside>
  <blockquote class="pull-quote">
    Those willing and able to
    accept their ordained rôle
    as itinerant scientists
    survive;
    those unwilling or unable
    do not.
  </blockquote>
</aside>

This is but a hasty example---I am sure somebody else
far more intelligent and skilful than myself
could
continue,
refine,
and expand upon this kind of reasoning,
and I would be keen to see the results.
The gist,
however,
is that
nobody involved is doing anything wrong---everyone
is simply behaving as a rational œconomic agent---but
these factors exert a certain selection pressure
on the academic community.
Those willing and able to
accept their ordained rôle
as itinerant scientists
survive;
those unwilling or unable
do not.

The question we must ask is:
Is this really what we want to select for?
Do we have reason to believe that these are the best scientists?
Perhaps they are the most dedicated
(for a certain definition of dedication),
and this may well be correlated with excellence in other metrics,
but if excellence is what we want,
we're looking at the long tails of the distribution of human traits,
and [the tails come apart](https://medium.com/@gjlewis/why-the-tails-come-apart-a6817e92651c).
Selecting scientists based on dedication
is like selecting basketball players based on height---you'll
probably pick better than a lottery,
but you'd be better off
actually watching them play basketball.

The inevitable followup is:
Could science of a similar standard,
or higher,
be done
differently?
Could we make the profession
more accessible
to those with families,
other commitments,
and mental or physical health issues?
I think the answer may be yes.
And while
it's not my place to do so,
I'd like to note that
family commitments
and increased risk aversion
are more common
in underrepresented groups;
perhaps making the profession
more stable and accessible
will do more good
for representation in the academy
than any fair
or outreach effort
ever could.

### Counterpoint

This decision has consumed my consciousness
for most of the last year,
at the very least,
and I do not take it lightly.
Some people will inevitably
think I am making the wrong decision.
Many who have made the same decision
[have come to regret
it](http://www.marcelhaas.com/index.php/2020/12/16/i-regret-quitting-astrophysics/)---after all,
the grass is always greener.
I have been wrong before
(like when I thought I wanted an academic career)
and I will be wrong again.

Perhaps I would enjoy an academic career
more than anything else.
Perhaps this system results in the best science.
Perhaps this is one case in which the tails don't come apart,
and the most dedicated scientists,
those most willing to give their lives to the pursuit of knowledge,
really are the best.
Perhaps it is naïf
or egocentric
for me to assume that I am *entitled* to an academic job.
Perhaps I am being too picky
and the expectation that I willingly relocate
my home and family
for a temporary job is a perfectly reasonable one.
Perhaps I am simply lashing out,
blaming others for my own failure,
and in truth I am simply not good enough.
Perhaps all of these things are true.

<aside>
  <blockquote class="pull-quote">
    Years of instability
    only weaken the positive exchange of ideas
    and shut out much of the diversity of minds
    from which we could otherwise benefit.
  </blockquote>
</aside>

There are certainly advantages to moving around.
By exposing oneself to different working environments,
one is exposed to new ways of thinking,
new methods and approaches to problems,
and discussions with a broader range of people.
There is undoubtedly a great deal of value in that,
and it is very important
to see the world outside one's bubble.
This is possibly the most convincing argument
in favour of the current system
of itinerant research,
and I don't have a good response
other than that I think the same ends
can be achieved in other ways---perhaps
the "loaning" of permanent employees
to other research groups,
or simply much stronger collaborative networks.
All things considered,
I think
years of instability
only weaken the positive exchange of ideas
and shut out much of the diversity of minds
from which we could otherwise benefit.

It may also be beneficial to
be able to select the best candidate
for a given project---if the tails come apart,
the best postdoc for one grant
may not also be the best for the next.
I touched on this
when discussing incentives
in the previous section,
and agree that this is rational.
However,
I am not sure the magnitude of this benefit
outweighs the costs of the current system,
considering that
successive projects in the same research group
are unlikely to suddenly require a completely different
set of skills
that can't be obtained through collaboration.
As well as the personal cost to researchers,
there is also a cost associated with
recruiting,
onboarding,
and integrating a new employee,
whereäs a permanent employee
is more likely to
be able to
hit the ground running
on a new project.

There may always be a need for consulting-type arrangements
and short-term contracts,
just as there is in industry,
but I dispute that there is likely to be
any significant benefit
from such arrangements as the norm.
Notice that
few other skilled jobs
rely on short-term labour
to the extent that academia does,
despite arguably stronger
incentives towards profitability.

I also acknowledge that
there are probably more people alive today
in a position to practise science
than at any point in history.
It is no longer necessary
to possess great wealth,
or the patronage of someone with wealth of their own,
to conduct research.
Not all that long ago,
I might have been expected to go and join some royal court
if I wished to do my simulations
(although I may have needed to invent the computer first).
Perhaps I have unreasonable expectations
about a system that has made so much progress already.

But none of this makes my life any easier.
Maybe my priorities are all muddled up,
but they remain my priorities.
I want to have a positive impact on the world,
but I also desire
stability,
financial security,
and a peaceful and rewarding home and family life.
I don't think I can get that in academia,
but I think I can elsewhere.
Your priorities may differ,
but I have little expectation
that I am alone in my desire for stability,
given that the bulk of my twenties is now behind me.
Accepting instability
as a fresh-faced young graduate
with nothing to tie them down
is one thing---but
can we really expect people
to work this way
well into their thirties?[^graduates]

[^graduates]: I actually think
    we expect too much mobility
    and poorly-calibrated "dedication"
    of graduates too,
    but I'm aware that
    a great many graduates
    seem willing to move
    for whatever graduate scheme will take them
    and my differing priorities
    may render me an outlier here.

I may well come to regret leaving academia,
but
on the balance of probabilities
I think I'd regret staying more.

### Final thoughts

I wish to reïterate
before closing
that I have no regrets
about the path that has led me here.
My PhD has been the privilege of my life,
and,
while I could perhaps have made better use
of the opportunities it presented to me,
I would not undo one iota of it.

I truly,
deeply
admire every single person
who manages to make academia work for them.
They have a mental fortitude
and flexibility
that I can only dream of emulating.
If you are among them,
thank you for the work
to which you have given your life---you
are enriching the global commons
and I salute you.
You are part of a chain
of scientists and philosophers
reaching all the way back to
Thales of Miletus[^thales]
that I hope remains forever unbroken.

[^thales]: [Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus)
           (Greek: Θάλῆς ὁ Μιλήσιος),
           born c.&nbsp;626--623&nbsp;BCE,
           was an ancient Greek philospher
           known as the "Father of Science"
           for his theory that everything in existence
           is made of the same primary substance:
           water.
           He was,
           of course,
           incorrect,
           but this did not preclude him
           from being a major influence
           on later thinkers
           including Plato and Aristotle.

But there is a systemic problem.
The academy is losing some incredible minds
(of which I can assure you I am not one),
and making worse the lives of those it retains---the
UK's academics have spent
[much of the last few years on strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%932020_UK_higher_education_strikes)
over a set of disputes
about pay,
pensions,
and working conditions.
Whatever your thoughts on those disputes,
one thing is inarguable:
They are unhappy and
the system is failing.
No,
not everybody needs to be a scientist,
and not everybody should,
but we should make sure that the best people can,
whatever their background and personal circumstances.

I have said nothing in this essay
that I have not seen or heard myriad times
from others at all stages of their careers,
and know I am not alone.
The academy is a global enterprise
and its problems
transcend national borders
every bit as much as do its successes.
The mental health of
our colleagues and friends
is suffering,
and so is our science.
Academic research
offers a unique opportunity
to observe the true beauty of creation in all its magnificent detail,
but we seem to have forgotten this.
Science will always have a place in my heart,
but our relationship is not a healthy one
and it's time I moved on.

For the world is hollow and I have touched the sky.
