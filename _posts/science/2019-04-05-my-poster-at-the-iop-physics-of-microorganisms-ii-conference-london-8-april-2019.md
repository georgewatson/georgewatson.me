I will be attending the Institute of Physics \"[Physics of
Microorganisms
II](https://www.iopconferences.org/iop/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=785982&eventID=1271&traceRedir=4)\"
conference in London on Monday, with my poster entitled \"**Atomistic
simulations unveil the influence of DNA topology on IHF--DNA
interaction**\".

**Abstract:**

> IHF is a nucleoid-associated DNA-binding protein that bends DNA by up
> to 160 degrees and is known to be vital to the stability of bacterial
> biofilms. Through atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of IHF
> bound to supercoiled DNA minicircles and linear DNA constructs, the
> DNA--IHF interaction is studied in unprecedented detail. Novel
> observations are made of key features of this interaction, including
> the existence of two clearly distinct binding modes and the formation
> of bridges between distal DNA sites by IHF, forming closed topological
> domains. Unlike canonical IHF binding, this bridging appears to be
> nonspecific, and may be the mechanism by which IHF stabilises crossing
> points in the extracellular DNA matrix in biofilms. Furthermore, IHF
> binding both modulates and is modulated by DNA topology, leading to a
> complex interplay that regulates the bacterial genome and allows
> regulatory information to be communicated over long distances. Further
> simulations involving IHF, related proteins, and DNA sequences with
> multiple binding sites, will soon converge with parallel
> single-molecule experiments to shed more light on the mechanisms
> underlying this biologically relevant process and the interactions
> between nucleoid-associated proteins and DNA.
