### Connection
{:#connection}

Your connection to this website is end-to-end encrypted using
[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).
This makes it difficult for eavesdroppers to read or interfere with your
communications with this website.

Both `georgewatson.me` and `dendodge.me` have valid SSL certificates issued via
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
The `georgewatson.me` domain,
including all its subdomains,
supports [HTTP Strict Transport Security
(HSTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
and has been submitted to the Chrome preload list.
This domain receives an [A+ rating from SSL
Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=georgewatson.me).

I recommend also using a private DNS protocol
such as DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS
to resolve domain names.
Nameservers supporting these protocols include
[1.1.1.1 by CloudFlare](https://1.1.1.1/dns/).

I can do very little to prevent your internet service provider,
employer,
government,
or parents from tracking your activity.
If you wish to secure your connection further,
consider connecting via an anonymous proxy,
a VPN,
or the
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
network.

### Data collection
{:#collection}

I offer the facility to
subscribe to new blog posts via an
[Atom feed](/feed.xml)
using your favourite RSS reader.
This does not involve giving me,
nor any third party,
any of your personal details
such as your name or email address.
You may choose to consume this Atom feed using your RSS/Atom reader of choice.

Like all websites,
some information may be stored in the server logs regarding your visit to this
website.
These logs include information such as your
[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) and
[User-Agent string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent),
the resources on this server you attempt to access,
the address of the page that referred you to the resource,
and the status code returned to you by the server,
along with the date and time.
This information does not identify you personally,
and is necessary for the operation and stability of the server.
These logs are handled by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/),
and I have no access to them;
[their privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) applies.

* [Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies)
  (on pages with embedded content from Google services such as YouTube)

You can probably disable cookies on a per-site basis in your browser settings.
See your browser's help pages for information on how to do this.
You can also delete cookies at any time.
See the [Opting Out](#opting-out) section for more information.

### Other organisations
{:#others}

I may embed content from other organisations.
This content is subject to those organisations' privacy policies.
If you do not agree to their terms,
it may be possible to disable tracking by visiting those websites.
Otherwise,
you can always block this content;
see the [Opting Out](#opting-out) section for details.

For your convenience,
a non-exhaustive list of such organisations is provided below,
including links to their privacy policies.

* [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

### Analytics
{:#analytics}

This website does not use web analytics.

Prior to 21 July 2020,
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) provided web
analytics on this website.
This consisted of aggregate data
and does not allow me to identify you personally.
This information is stored on Google's servers.
See [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) for
more information.

The Google Analytics code was never loaded if your browser sent a
[Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (`DNT`) header.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) may record and analyse your traffic for their own purposes,
but this information is not currently available to me.
[Their privacy policy](https://www.netlify.com/privacy/) applies.

### Opting Out
{:#opting-out}

You can opt out of cookies by disabling them for this website ---
or for all websites ---
in your browser settings.
Existing cookies can be deleted in your browser,
probably near where your history is stored.
You could also choose to browse in Private/Incognito mode.

You can disable embedded widgets such as YouTube videos
by disabling JavaScript in your browser,
or by using one of the many browser extensions that allow you to block specific
frames of external content.
This prevents these companies from tracking you.
Where it is reasonable to do so, an appropriate fallback will be provided.

Your User-Agent string can probably be changed in your browser.
Your IP address can be masked by using a web proxy or VPN service,
many of which are available for free.
Any referrer information can be removed from your request
by pasting the URL directly into your address bar
instead of following a hyperlink.
If you're privacy-conscious enough to care about these things,
you probably already know what you're doing.

These opt-out mechanisms are simple and standardised, and provide fine-grained
control across multiple websites.
I consider this superior to the deliberately difficult, confusing, and
non-standard mechanisms provided by most websites in the name of GDPR
compliance.

### Jurisdiction
{:#jurisdiction}

I reside in England, in the United Kingdom.
Hosting is provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/),
a company based in San Francisco, California, in the United States.

Every effort has been made to comply with the laws of
England & Wales
and the wider United Kingdom.
I am not bound by the laws of any other legal system,
and it is your responsibility to ensure that you are not breaking any local laws by
visiting or interacting with this website.

I am not responsible for the content or policies of most external websites,
even if I embed or hyperlink to them.
Linking to,
embedding,
discussing,
or recommending an external website or organisation does not imbue me with
responsibility for that website or organisation's actions,
and should not be viewed as an endorsement of their policies.
Other websites will have privacy policies that differ from this one.
It is your responsibility to ensure that you agree to the terms of any
websites or organisations with which you choose to interact.
