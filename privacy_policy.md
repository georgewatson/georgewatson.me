### Connection
{:#connection}

Your connection to this website is end-to-end encrypted using
[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security).
This makes it difficult for eavesdroppers to read or interfere with your
communications with this website.
The CDN delivering this website
(provided by CloudFlare)
is configured to support only TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3.
It is recommended that you use a browser that supports the latest version of the
protocol.

Both `georgewatson.me` and `dendodge.me` have valid SSL certificates issued via
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
The `georgewatson.me` domain,
including all its subdomains,
supports [HTTP Strict Transport Security
(HSTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
and has been submitted to the Chrome preload list.
This domain receives an [A+ rating from SSL
Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=georgewatson.me).
The `dendodge.me` domain is deliberately preserved as a backup in case of an
issue with the HTTPS/HSTS configuration,
but still fully supports HTTPS and receives an
[A rating](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=dendodge.me).
The canonical domain for this website is `georgewatson.me`.
It is strongly recommended that you use this domain to access this website.

I recommend also using a private DNS protocol
such as DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS
to resolve domain names.
Nameservers supporting these protocols include
[1.1.1.1 by CloudFlare](https://1.1.1.1/dns/).

I can do very little to prevent your internet service provider,
employer,
government,
or parents from tracking your activity.
If you wish to secure your connection further,
consider connecting via an anonymous proxy,
a VPN,
or the
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
network.

### Data collection
{:#collection}

I offer the facility to
subscribe to new blog posts by email.
This service is provided by
[follow.it](https://follow.it).
You are under no obligation to use this service,
but if you do
I will be able to see your email address
and the date on which you subscribed.
This information is securely stored on follow.it's servers.
You can unsubscribe at any time.
If you prefer not to subscribe by email,
you can see all new posts
by checking
[the blog](/blog)
regularly
or subscribing to the
[Atom feed](/feed.xml)
using your favourite RSS reader.

Like all websites,
some information may be stored in my server logs regarding your visit to this
website.
These logs include information such as your
[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) and
[User-Agent string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent),
the resources on this server you attempt to access,
the address of the page that referred you to the resource,
and the status code returned to you by the server,
along with the date and time.
This information does not identify you personally,
and is necessary for the operation and stability of the server.
The log files are stored securely on a virtual private server hosted by
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/),
and are regularly rotated.
No copies are ever made of any part of these logs.

* [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/cookie-policy/)
* [Google](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies)
  (on pages with embedded content from Google services)
* [Remarkbox](https://www.remarkbox.com/privacy-policy.html)
  (on pages with embedded comments sections)
* [Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies)
  (on pages with embedded Twitter widgets)

You can probably disable cookies on a per-site basis in your browser settings.
See your browser's help pages for information on how to do this.
You can also delete cookies at any time.
See the [Opting Out](#opting-out) section for more information.

### Other organisations
{:#others}

I may embed content from other organisations.
This content is subject to those organisations' privacy policies.
If you do not agree to their terms,
it may be possible to disable tracking by visiting those websites.
Otherwise,
you can always block this content;
see the [Opting Out](#opting-out) section for details.

For your convenience,
a non-exhaustive list of such organisations is provided below,
including links to their privacy policies.
I recommend that you familiarise yourself with these,
since these all form core parts of the modern Web infrastructure
and are widely used across many websites.

* [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/privacy-policy/)
* [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/)
* [Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* [Remarkbox](https://www.remarkbox.com/privacy-policy.html)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/en/privacy)

### Analytics
{:#analytics}

This website does not use web analytics
beyond the information stored in Apache server logs
and CloudFlare traffic data.

Prior to 21 July 2020,
[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) provided web
analytics on this website.
This consisted of aggregate data
and does not allow me to identify you personally.
This information is stored on Google's servers.
See [Google's privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en) for
more information.

The Google Analytics code was never loaded if your browser sent a
[Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (`DNT`) header.

### Opting Out
{:#opting-out}

You can opt out of cookies by disabling them for this website ---
or for all websites ---
in your browser settings.
Existing cookies can be deleted in your browser,
probably near where your history is stored.
You could also choose to browse in Private/Incognito mode.

You can opt out of
some third-party analytics by sending the
[Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) (`DNT`) header with
your HTTPS request.
You can probably enable this in your browser's settings.

You can disable embedded widgets such as comments and Twitter timelines
by disabling JavaScript in your browser,
or by using one of the many browser extensions that allow you to block specific
frames of external content.
This prevents these companies from tracking you.
Where it is reasonable to do so, an appropriate fallback will be provided.

Your User-Agent string can probably be changed in your browser.
Your IP address can be masked by using a web proxy or VPN service,
many of which are available for free.
Any referrer information can be removed from your request
by pasting the URL directly into your address bar
instead of following a hyperlink.
If you're privacy-conscious enough to care about these things,
you probably already know what you're doing.

These opt-out mechanisms are simple and standardised, and provide fine-grained
control across multiple websites.
I consider this superior to the deliberately difficult, confusing, and
non-standard mechanisms provided by most websites in the name of GDPR
compliance.

### Jurisdiction
{:#jurisdiction}

I reside in England, in the United Kingdom.
My server is hosted in London, UK,
by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/),
a company based in New York, United States.

Sadly, I am
[no longer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit)
located in the European Union.
However,
I intend to continue to follow EU law in anticipation of the UK's
re-entry into the EU.

Every effort has been made to comply with the laws of
England & Wales,
the wider UK,
and the EU.
I am not bound by the laws of any other legal system;
it is your responsibility to ensure that you are not breaking any local laws by
visiting or interacting with this website.

I am not responsible for the content or policies of most external websites,
even if I embed or hyperlink to them.
Linking to,
embedding,
discussing,
or recommending an external website or organisation does not imbue me with
responsibility for that website or organisation's actions,
and should not be viewed as an endorsement of their policies.
Other websites will have privacy policies that differ from this one.
Nothing in this privacy policy applies to other websites,
and it is your responsibility to ensure that you agree to the terms of any
websites or organisations with which you choose to interact.
